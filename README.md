# Specification Builder

A tiny library that helps developers to build and combine complex specifications together with Spring Data JPA.

## Quick Start
It's enough to add this dependency to use this library.
```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.kodgemisi</groupId>
    <artifactId>specification-builder</artifactId>
    <version>${specification-builder.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<repositories>

</repositories>
```

## How To Use

```java
  Specification<Person> specification = GenericSpecificationBuilder.<Person>of(Person.class)
 				.join("accounts")
 				.joinFetch("notifications")
 				.equals("name", name)
 				.equals("company.name", companyName, RelationType.TO_ONE)
 				.equals("addresses.type", addressType, , RelationType.TO_MANY)
 				.greaterThan("wage.amount", minWageAmount, RelationType.TO_ONE)
 				.greaterThanOrEqualTo("birthDate", minBirthDate)
 				.lessThanOrEqualTo("birthDate", maxBirthDate)
 				.like("about", keyword)
 				.likeIgnoreCase("about", keyword)
 				.in("city", cities)
 				.custom(customSpecification)
 				.build();
```
There is just `GenericSpecificationBuilder` class to build your specification as you see above. 
You must define your entity in `of(Person.class)` method and then you can chain your query parameters.
When you are done with your query, just `build()` it. That's all.

- `join` and `joinFetch`: You can make join or join fetch if you need
- `equals(key, value)`: `key` paramater is the field of your entity and `value` is parameter
- `equals(key, value, relationType)`: You can also build a query with filtering relations of an entity.
There is `relationType` enum parameter which provided by the library.
It is used by `RelationType.TO_MANY` or `RelationType.TO_ONE` according to relation of your entities between.

**`RelationType` is also applicable to other methods like `greaterThan` or `like` etc..**

There is also a good feature which provides you to add a custom specifications that the library can't handle.
As you see in the example above, just add `custom(spec)` method to the chain and your specification will be added.
